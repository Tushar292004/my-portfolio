It's been just over 40 days since I joined Medzillo as a Full Stack Developer, and the journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding. Under the inspiring vision of Raghul Anandan, I'm contributing to an ambitious project that's shaping not just a product, but also a dynamic team culture.

## What I've Been Working On

- **MVP Development:** Building and iterating on our core product, ensuring it's reliable, scalable, and ready for production.
- **Team Formation:** Leading the hiring and onboarding of interns, and fostering a collaborative, growth-oriented environment.
- **Tech Stack Choices:** Selecting the right tools and platforms to balance cost-effectiveness with performance and scalability.
- **Planning:** Structuring our development lifecycle and work plans to manage a rapidly growing codebase.

I'm still deep in the process, working toward the MVP's completion and its eventual market launch. Every day brings new lessons and opportunities to grow as a developer and a team player.
