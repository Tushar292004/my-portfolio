Have you ever faced a situation where you request an OTP, but it never reaches your phone? This might not just be a network issue—it could be an SS7 attack.

Recently, I experienced this while trying to get an OTP for DigiLocker. Despite multiple attempts, I wasn’t receiving the OTP. Instead, I was informed that a new OTP would be shared after 24 hours. This raised red flags, and I decided to check where my Aadhaar was registered for any unauthorized access. That’s when I realized how serious SS7 vulnerabilities can be.

**What is SS7?**

SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) is the protocol that telecom networks use to communicate globally. However, vulnerabilities in SS7 can be exploited by attackers to intercept messages, including OTPs. This means hackers can receive your OTPs and gain access to sensitive accounts like DigiLocker, Aadhaar verification, IRCTC, banking services, and more. Shockingly, all an attacker needs is just your mobile number to launch an SS7 attack and target you.

This is one of the key reasons why many Indian users lose access to their Gmail, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. Cybercriminals exploit this loophole to hijack accounts and steal personal data.

What's even more alarming? SS7 attacks can also be used to track your live location! This method was reportedly used to capture Princess Latifa of Dubai when she attempted to flee on a boat to India.

## How to Stay Safe

With increasing cyber threats, it’s crucial to stay aware and take security measures:

- Enable app-based authentication instead of SMS OTPs.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
- Be cautious of phishing scams and unauthorized login attempts.

Cybersecurity is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. Stay safe online!
